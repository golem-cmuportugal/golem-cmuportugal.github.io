  abstract  = {The demand to develop more applications and in a faster way has been increasing over the years. Even non-experienced developers are jumping into the market thanks to low-code development platforms such as OutSystems. OSTRICH, a type-safe rich template language for the OutSystems platform, allows for the definition and instantiation of type-safe templates while ensuring a clear separation between compile-time and runtime computations. We formalise this two-stage language and introduce new features to the OSTRICH language, namely parametric polymorphism and a simplified form of dependent types. Such features enable instantiating the most commonly used OutSystems templates, reducing the knowledge required by the developer and easing the development process.},

  abstract  = {Low code development platforms allow for the design, deployment, and maintenance of software applications through a graphical user interface which is targeted, primarily, at non-expert users. Despite the graphical interface being more accessible than plain text programming, the end user still needs to identify and put together the required building blocks to achieve the intended behavior, and this generally requires some basic knowledge of programming. To tackle this problem, I present an approach to low code programming by introducing a dialogue interface to such platforms.},
